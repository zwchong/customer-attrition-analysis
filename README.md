**Tools Used:** SQL · Excel · Python · Tableau  
**Project Goal:** Analyze and visualize attrition behavior to identify customer segments most at risk of leaving a telecom company.

---

## Overview

This project explores customer attrition patterns using a real-world telecom dataset. The goal is to generate business insights using SQL and Excel, then tell a compelling story through a Tableau dashboard.

Attrition analysis helps businesses understand which customer groups are more likely to leave and why. These insights can inform strategies for customer retention, onboarding improvements, and service enhancements.

## Key Business Questions

- Which contract types are associated with higher attrition?
- How does internet service type influence attrition behavior?
- Are short-term or long-term customers more likely to leave?

---

## Key Insights

- **Month-to-month contract customers** had the highest attrition — likely due to flexibility and lack of commitment.
- Customers with **fiber optic internet** showed higher attrition — suggesting issues with service experience or pricing.
- Customers with **short tenure (<12 months)** were more likely to leave — highlighting the importance of early engagement.
